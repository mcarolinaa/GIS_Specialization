# NDVI variation in agricultural areas across climatic events

This repo contains some of the work I did as my final project during my GIS Specialization from UC Davis, offered by Coursera.

In this project, I wanted to analyze if a vegetation index (NDVI) varied in agricultural areas between years of different climatic events: El niño, La niña and Neutral years.

For a particular location in Mato Grosso state, Brazil, with lots of agricultural areas, I used satellite imagery from Landsat from specific years of these climatic events.
I also analyzed climatic data from these years to investigate this question.


# Requirements
1- Landsat imagery of years of different climatic events (I used 3, one for each event)
2- GIS software (Here I used ArcGIS)
3- Meteorological data (I used daily rainfall data from NASA Power)
4- I used R to import and analyze meteorological data and variation of agricultural area across years


# What's in here
In this repo, the R code shows the importing of raw meteorological data and data visualization.
The workflow contains the description of all main steps I took inside ArcGIS in order to perform this analysis.
The PDF shows the final maps of each situation: neutral vs. la ninã, neutral vs. el niño and el niño vs. la niña
